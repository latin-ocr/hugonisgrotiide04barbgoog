Rev. H. A. Holden, Fellou of Trinity Collega, who had

The Notes of Gronovius, which occupy u considerable·
portion of the page of the most common editions of Gro-
tius, are in reulity of very little vulne. It is doubted by
Tydmau‚ n more recent editor, (Utrecht, 1773) whether
they were intended for publication3 nnd they may in
general be omitted without loss. A few uotiees taken
from thern heve been retained.

As further illustrating Barbcyruc’s labours ou this
work‚1huve inserted his Pr'efoce including the passage
in which he expresses an nnsuvournhle jndgment ot' the
valae of the Notes of Gronovius. In this preface, th=
references to Burbeyruc’s own Notes are here mude oc—
eording to the mode adopted in the present edition ;
namely, by means of the Arabio numerals from 1 to 9 ;
the Notes of Grotius being marked by the letters of th -10
alphabet, es in the earlier editions.
