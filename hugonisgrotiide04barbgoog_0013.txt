speculation was originally derived, proceed upon the sup·
position that there is a body of Natural Law, Jaa Natura,
distinct from Instituted Lan· (Jur Gratiam and Jna Ciuile),
and belonging to mun by his nature. I hare elsewhere*
endeavoured to shew that though inan nowhere exists, and
by his nature cannot exist, without Laws, there is no special
body of Laws which ean distinctirely be called Natural Lata, -
Juc Natura. 1 have noted (Elementa os Morality. 1052) the
inconsistencies into which Grotius, as well as others, is

ticular cases. But 1 hare also (1053,1054) pointed out
the truths which were osten expressed by means of this
distinction; namely, that the actual Law of any commu· ·
nity might be worse than it is; und that it may be better.
The Jnc Nature may be the mere rudiments out of which
the Jua Gentium is to be fashioned; or it may be the
lotty ideal which the Jna Gentium never reaches. Both
these lines oi speculation ere very interesting and instruc·

jurists the use of the phraseology which they hare been
accustomed to employ on such questions; aad which is
osten convenient and useful sor these and other purposcs.
Jna Gentiana is a phrase which, about the time of Gro· ”

Grotius’s work arises, in a great mensure, sronr his setting
out frona the first of these incanings, in order to discuss
the second. Ile thus begins with the philosophy of ethica,

and ends with exhortations to hnnrarrity, truth, and justice,

peculiarly his object than the fonnem for the narrow and
