lxxviii PROLEGOhOENd.

nullis amen loeis ejus quod utile est feci mentionem, sed
obiter, ct ιιι id ipsum a justi quastione apertius distin-
guerglgl· Iajuriam mihi faciet, si quis me ad ullas nostri seerdi

conhoversias, aut natas, aut quae nasciturae praevideri pos·
sant, respexisse arbitratur. Vere enim profiteor, deut ma·
thematici figuras a corporibus'semotas considerant, ita me in
jure tractando ab omni singulari iacto abduxisse animum

vemt 59 Dicendi genus quod attinet, nolui ad rerum tractan-
wana darum multitudinem adjungendo verborum copiam fastidium

parere lectori, cujas utilitatibus consulebam. ltaque secutus
sum quantum potas concisum ct docenti conveniens loquendi
genus: ,ιιι tauquam in uno conspeetu habeant, qui negotia
publica tractant, et quae incidere solent controversiarum .
genera, et principia unde dijudicari possum: quibas cognitis
facilc erit ad rem subjectam accommodare orationem et quan·
tum lubet extendere.

thus differing from Rudinus, in whom this Art is confounded :ith

. Jus in our senso. In some cases, however, 1 have mode mention of
the Utility of acts3 but collaterally only, aad in order ιο distinguish
that question tho more plainly from the question ot Right.

58 The reeder will do me injustice, if he judgcs me ιο have
written with a rogard to any controversias of our-own time; either
such as already exist, or such as can be screseen as likely ιο arise-
1 profess, in all sincerity, that, as mathematicians consider their
figures as abstracted from body, ιο did 1, iu treating ot itights, ab·
straet my mind from every particular fact.

59 As to the style, 1 was unwilling, by adding prolixityff lan·
guage te the multitude ef the matters treated oi, te wcary the reader
whom 1 wished ιο benofit. Itherofore hare followed a concise and

‘ diductio mode ot* treatmentz that they who hare ιο manage public
affairs, may see, at ono view, the kinds of controversias which are
wont to arise, and the principles by which they are edus decided:
this being known, it will be easy to accommodate their own dis·
eourses ιο the subject, and to expand the discussion as much es
they please. λ

60 1 have adduced tho words of the authors themselves, when
they were such as either carried with them authority, er exhibited
especial elegance: and this 1 have sometimes done iu Greek authent
but mostly, when either tho quotation was short, er eac oi vhiehl
despaircd of imitating the grace iu a Latin translation: euch a trane
lationi have however added in orory instance, for the henam ef th⁰³⁰
who find the Greek difficult.
