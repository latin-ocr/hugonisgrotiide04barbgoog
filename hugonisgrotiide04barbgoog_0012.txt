Hobbcs, found law and morality on the mutual sear of men,
and from those who proclaim utility as the basis of their
system but also from later and celebrated dissertatore
upon Natural Law, such as Kant and Fiehte, and other ,
German philosophcrs. Α recent writer* on this subject
has justly remarkcd this distinction: that Grotius does
not, as those philosophers do, sech the ground and basis
Xof Rights in the insulated existence of the individual, but
in the social relations of men. The critic remarks, also,
that we do not find in him that strenuous attempt to sepa·
rate jurnl srom moral doctrines, which, in the Kantion
period, was regarded as the essential condition sor the
’ proper development of jural philosophy: nor, again, do we
meet in Grotius with that perpetual hnmmcring upon the
innate srecdom ol the Person as sueh; with the assump
tion that the Person, in virtue of his mere existence as a
Person, is the bearer and possessor of an indefinite mass
of Rights, all which may be asserted by force; while yet,
on the other hand, the Person may, in cases of necessity,
have to acquiesce in the mere possibility of acquiring
llight, as the sole result of his Personality. And hence,
as the writer just quoted further remarks, we do not
find in him the harsh ond startling propositions which
occur so frequently in the jural speculations of the Kantion
period.
